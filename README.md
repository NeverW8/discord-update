# Discord-update
A simple bash script to Update discord on Debian based systems.

## How to run
In your terminal, run these two commands:
Chmod +x to make it executable
`sudo chmod +x discord-update.sh`
Then run it like this:
`./discord-update.sh`

Shouldn't be anything more than that.

I made this for a friend, so if you wanna suggest changes or bugs, open an issue. Have a nice day. :)
